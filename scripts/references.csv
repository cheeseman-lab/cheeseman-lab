Here, we show that Tpr is required for normal SAC response by stabilizing Mad1 and Mad2 before mitosis. Tpr coimmunoprecipitated with Mad1 and Mad2 (hereafter designated as Tpr/Mad1/Mad2 or TM2 complex) during interphase and mitosis, and is required for Mad1–c-Mad2 recruitment to NPCs. Interestingly, Tpr was normally undetectable at kinetochores and dispensable for Mad1, but not for Mad2, kinetochore localization, which suggests that SAC robustness depends on Mad2 levels at kinetochores. Protein half-life measurements demonstrate that Tpr stabilizes Mad1 and Mad2, ensuring normal Mad1–c-Mad2 production in an mRNA- and kinetochore-independent manner. Overexpression of GFP-Mad2 restored normal SAC response and Mad2 kinetochore levels in Tpr-depleted cells. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that Tpr might spatially regulate SAC proteostasis through the SUMO-isopeptidases SENP1 and SENP2 at NPCs. Thus, Tpr is a kinetochore-independent, rate-limiting factor required to mount and sustain a robust SAC response.","","","","en","Research Article",""

In vertebrates, these attachments require the activities of a number of outer kinetochore proteins, including CENP-F [1, 2] and the widely conserved microtubule-associated protein CLASP [3]. Here, we investigate the functional relationship between HCP-1/2, two redundant CENP-F-like proteins, and CLASP(CLS-2) in Caenorhabditis elegans. HCP-1/2 and CLASP(CLS-2) localize transiently to mitotic C. elegans kinetochores with nearly identical kinetic profiles, and biochemical purifications demonstrate that they also associate physically. In embryos depleted of HCP-1/2, CLASP(CLS-2) no longer localizes to chromosomes, whereas CLASP(CLS-2) depletion does not prevent HCP-1/2 targeting. Consistent with the localization dependency and biochemical association, depletion of HCP-1/2 or CLASP(CLS-2) resulted in virtually identical defects in mitotic chromosome segregation characterized by a failure of sister-chromatid biorientation. This phenotype could be partially suppressed by disrupting the astral forces that pull spindle poles apart in the 1 cell embryo, indicating that CLASP(CLS-2) is required for biorientation when chromosome-spindle attachments are subjected to poleward force. Our results establish that the key role of HCP-1/2 is to target CLASP(CLS-2) to kinetochores, and they support the recently proposed model that CLASP functions to promote the polymerization of kinetochore bound microtubules [4].","","http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/","Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, 92093, USA. icheeseman@ucsd.edu","en","Research Article",""

The Wak1 gene was mapped and found to lie in a tight cluster of five highly similar genes (Wak1-5) within a 30 kb region. All of the Wak genes encode a cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase, a transmembrane domain, and an extracytoplasmic region with several epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats. The extracellular regions also contain limited amino acid identities to the tenascin superfamily, collagen, or the neurexins. RNA blot analysis with gene-specific probes revealed that Wak1, Wak3 and Wak5 are expressed primarily in leaves and stems of Arabidopsis. Wak4 mRNA is only detected in siliques, while Wak2 mRNA is found in high levels in leaves and stems, and in lower levels in flowers and siliques. A trace amount of Wak2 can also be detected in roots. Wak1 is induced by pathogen infection and salicylic acid or its analogue INA and is involved in the plant's response, and Wak2, Wak3 and Wak5 also can be greatly induced by salicylic acid or INA. The WAK proteins have the potential to serve as both linkers of the cell wall to the plasma membrane and as signaling molecules, and since Wak expression is organ-specific and the isoforms vary significantly in the cell wall associated domain this family of proteins may be involved in cell wall-plasma membrane interactions that direct fundamental processes in angiosperms.","","","Botany Department, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.","en","Research Article",""

However, the precise mechanisms that target CENP-A to centromeres remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated a multi-subunit complex, which includes the established inner kinetochore components CENP-H and CENP-I, and nine other proteins, from both human and chicken cells. Our analysis of these proteins demonstrates that the CENP-H-I complex can be divided into three functional sub-complexes, each of which is required for faithful chromosome segregation. Interestingly, newly expressed CENP-A is not efficiently incorporated into centromeres in knockout mutants of a subclass of CENP-H-I complex proteins, indicating that the CENP-H-I complex may function, in part, as a marker directing CENP-A deposition to centromeres.","","","Department of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Genetics and The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.","en","Research Article",""

The dynein/dynactin motor complex localizes transiently to kinetochores and is implicated in chromosome segregation, but its role remains poorly understood. Here, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo to investigate the function of kinetochore dynein by analyzing the Rod/Zwilch/Zw10 (RZZ) complex and the associated coiled-coil protein SPDL-1. Both components are essential for Mad2 targeting to kinetochores and spindle checkpoint activation. RZZ complex inhibition, which abolishes both SPDL-1 and dynein/dynactin targeting to kinetochores, slows but does not prevent the formation of load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments and reduces the fidelity of chromosome segregation. Surprisingly, inhibition of SPDL-1, which abolishes dynein/dynactin targeting to kinetochores without perturbing RZZ complex localization, prevents the formation of load-bearing attachments during most of prometaphase and results in extensive chromosome missegregation. Coinhibition of SPDL-1 along with the RZZ complex reduces the phenotypic severity to that observed following RZZ complex inhibition alone. We propose that the RZZ complex can inhibit the formation of load-bearing attachments and that this activity of the RZZ complex is normally controlled by dynein/dynactin localized via SPDL-1.

Here, we describe a method, based on expression of a genetically encoded fusion protein, that allows for protein localization and affinity purification (LAP) in metazoans. This method makes it possible to rapidly identify transformants and to conduct live imaging of protein localization and dynamics. In addition, the same tag can be used in a modified tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure to isolate native protein complexes of high purity. The efficacy of this purification procedure allows for the characterization of rare protein complexes that are largely inaccessible to classical biochemical purifications. The LAP strategy should be widely applicable to the characterization of protein function in cellular and developmental contexts in various metazoans.","","","Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. icheeseman@ucsd.edu <icheeseman@ucsd.edu>","en","Research Article",""

To better understand how kinetochores attach to microtubules and how this attachment is regulated, we sought to characterize the interactions among kinetochore proteins, especially with respect to the microtubule-binding Dam1 complex. The Dam1 complex plays a crucial role in the chromosome-spindle attachment and is a key target for phospho-regulation of this attachment by the Aurora kinase Ipl1p. To identify protein-protein interactions involving the Dam1 complex, and the effects of Dam1p phosphorylation state on these physical interactions, we conducted both a genome-wide two-hybrid screen and a series of biochemical binding assays for Dam1p. A two-hybrid screen of a library of 6000 yeast open reading frames identified nine kinetochore proteins as Dam1p-interacting partners. From 113 in vitro binding reactions involving all nine subunits of the Dam1 complex and 32 kinetochore proteins, we found at least nine interactions within the Dam1 complex and 19 potential partners for the Dam1 complex. Strikingly, we found that the Dam1p-Ndc80p and Dam1p-Spc34p interactions were weakened by mutations mimicking phosphorylation at Ipl1p sites, allowing us to formulate a model for the effects of phosphoregulation on kinetochore function.","","","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-3202, USA.","en","Research Article",""

In this study, we show that during mitosis the MT- and KT-associated protein CLASP2 is progressively and distinctively phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Plk1 kinases, concomitant with the establishment of KT-MT attachments. CLASP2 S1234 was phosphorylated by Cdk1, which primed CLASP2 for association with Plk1. Plk1 recruitment to KTs was enhanced by CLASP2 phosphorylation on S1234. This was specifically required to stabilize KT-MT attachments important for chromosome alignment and to coordinate KT and non-KT MT dynamics necessary to maintain spindle bipolarity.

Here, we demonstrate that two constitutive DNA-binding kinetochore components, CENP-C and CENP-T, function to direct kinetochore formation. Replacing the DNA-binding regions of CENP-C and CENP-T with alternate chromosome-targeting domains recruits these proteins to ectopic loci, resulting in CENP-A-independent kinetochore assembly. These ectopic kinetochore-like foci are functional based on the stoichiometric assembly of multiple kinetochore components, including the microtubule-binding KMN network, the presence of microtubule attachments, the microtubule-sensitive recruitment of the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2, and the segregation behavior of foci-containing chromosomes. We additionally find that CENP-T phosphorylation regulates the mitotic assembly of both endogenous and ectopic kinetochores.

However, kinetochore components do not function in isolation, and previous studies did not comprehensively compare the expression behavior of kinetochore components. Here we analyze the expression behavior of the full range of human kinetochore components in diverse published expression compendia, including normal tissues and tumor samples. Our results demonstrate that kinetochore genes are rarely overexpressed individually. Instead, we find that core kinetochore genes are coordinately regulated with other cell division genes under virtually all conditions. This expression pattern is strongly correlated with the expression of the forkhead transcription factor FoxM1, which binds to the majority of cell division promoters.

Here, we perform time-lapse imaging to analyze anaphase chromosome dynamics in human cells. Using multiple directed biochemical, genetic, and physical perturbations, our results demonstrate that differences in the global phosphorylation states between metaphase and anaphase are the major determinant of chromosome motion dynamics. Indeed, causing a mitotic phosphorylation state to persist into anaphase produces dramatic metaphase-like oscillations. These induced oscillations depend on both kinetochore-derived and polar ejection forces that oppose poleward motion. Thus, our analysis of anaphase chromosome motion reveals that dephosphorylation of multiple mitotic substrates is required to suppress metaphase chromosome oscillatory motions and achieve directed poleward motion for successful chromosome segregation.","chromokinesin; kinetochore; microtubule; mitosis; phosphorylation","","Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.; Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Chromosome Instability and Dynamics Laboratory, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal; i3S - Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúdem, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.; Chromosome Instability and Dynamics Laboratory, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal; i3S - Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúdem, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal; Cell Division Unit, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.; Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

The implementation of CRISPR/Cas9-based DNA cleavage has revolutionized the capacity to conduct functional studies in human cells.

Prevailing models indicate that the high intrinsic stability of CENP-A nucleosomes maintains centromere identity indefinitely. Here, we demonstrate that CENP-A is not stable at centromeres but is instead gradually and continuously incorporated in quiescent cells including G0-arrested tissue culture cells and prophase I-arrested oocytes. Quiescent CENP-A incorporation involves the canonical CENP-A deposition machinery but displays distinct requirements from cell cycle-dependent deposition. We demonstrate that Plk1 is required specifically for G1 CENP-A deposition, whereas transcription promotes CENP-A incorporation in quiescent oocytes. Preventing CENP-A deposition during quiescence results in significantly reduced CENP-A levels and perturbs chromosome segregation following the resumption of cell division. In contrast to quiescent cells, terminally differentiated cells fail to maintain CENP-A levels. Our work reveals that quiescent cells actively maintain centromere identity providing an indicator of proliferative potential.","cell division; centromere; epigenetics; kinetochore; meiosis; mitosis; oocyte; quiescence; terminal differentiation","http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/","Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 455 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.; Biology Department, UNC Chapel Hill, 120 South Road, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280, USA.; Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, 455 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

Here we identify the microtubule-binding protein centriole and spindle-associated protein (CSAP), which colocalizes with polyglutamylated tubulin to centrioles, spindle microtubules, and cilia in human tissue culture cells. Reducing tubulin polyglutamylation prevents CSAP localization to both spindle and cilia microtubules.

In this paper, we used a live-cell imaging-based assay to quantify kinetochore disassembly kinetics and systematically analyze the role of potential regulatory mechanisms in controlling kinetochore assembly state. We find that kinetochore assembly and disassembly was driven primarily by mitotic phosphorylation downstream of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). In addition, we demonstrate that nuclear exclusion of the Ndc80 complex helped restrict kinetochore formation to mitosis. Combining constitutive CDK-dependent phosphorylation of CENP-T and forced nuclear localization of the Ndc80 complex partially prevented kinetochore disassembly at mitotic exit and led to chromosome segregation defects in subsequent divisions.

Second, we find that asymmetric plasma membrane elongation occurs in response to spindle mispositioning to alter the cellular boundaries relative to the spindle. Asymmetric membrane elongation is promoted by chromosome-derived Ran-GTP signals that locally reduce Anillin at the growing cell cortex. In asymmetrically elongating cells, dynein-dependent spindle anchoring at the stationary cell cortex ensures proper spindle positioning.

Here, we identify polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as a centromere-localized regulator required to initiate CENP-A deposition in human cells. We demonstrate that faithful CENP-A deposition requires integrated signals from Plk1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), with Plk1 promoting the localization of the key CENP-A deposition factor, the Mis18 complex, and CDK inhibiting Mis18 complex assembly.

Unlike the long isoform, short SKAP rescues SKAP depletion in mitosis and displays robust microtubule plus-end tracking, including localization to astral microtubules. Eliminating SKAP microtubule binding results in severe chromosome segregation defects. In contrast, SKAP mutants specifically defective for plus-end tracking facilitate proper chromosome segregation but display spindle positioning defects.

Although most dynein-associated proteins localize to unaligned kinetochores in an Aurora B-dependent manner, Astrin, SKAP, and LC8 localization is antagonized by Aurora B such that they target exclusively to bioriented kinetochores. Astrin-SKAP-depleted cells fail to maintain proper chromosome alignment, resulting in a spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic delay. Consistent with a role in stabilizing bioriented attachments, Astrin and SKAP bind directly to microtubules and are required for CLASP localization to kinetochores.

The kinetochore-localized human Ska1 complex binds to microtubules and tracks with depolymerizing microtubule ends [2]. We now demonstrate that the Ska1 complex also autonomously tracks with growing microtubule ends in vitro, a key property that would allow this complex to act at kinetochores to mediate persistent associations with dynamic microtubules.

We generated mutations on distinct surfaces of the Ska1 microtubule binding domain that disrupt binding to soluble tubulin but do not prevent microtubule binding. These mutants display compromised microtubule tracking activity in vitro and result in defective chromosome alignment and mitotic progression in cells using a CRISPR/Cas9-based replacement assay.

Although recent work has identified developmental and extrinsic cues that regulate spindle orientation, the contribution of intrinsic signals to spindle positioning and orientation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cortical force generation in human cells is controlled by distinct spindle-pole- and chromosome-derived signals that regulate cytoplasmic dynein localization. First, dynein exhibits a dynamic asymmetric cortical localization that is negatively regulated by spindle-pole proximity, resulting in spindle oscillations to centre the spindle within the cell. We find that this signal comprises the spindle-pole-localized polo-like kinase (Plk1), which regulates dynein localization by controlling the interaction between dynein-dynactin and its upstream cortical targeting factors NuMA and LGN. Second, a chromosome-derived RanGTP gradient restricts the localization of NuMA-LGN to the lateral cell cortex to define and maintain the spindle orientation axis. RanGTP acts in part through the nuclear localization sequence of NuMA to locally alter the ability of NuMA-LGN to associate with the cell cortex in the vicinity of chromosomes. We propose that these chromosome- and spindle-pole-derived gradients generate an intrinsic code to control spindle position and orientation.","","","Whitehead Institute, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA.","en","Research Article",""

Defining the molecular architecture of the core kinetochore components is critical for understanding the mechanisms by which the kinetochore directs chromosome segregation. The KNL1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex (KMN) network acts as the primary microtubule-binding interface at kinetochores [3] and provides a platform to recruit regulatory proteins [4]. Recent work found that the inner kinetochore components CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit the KMN network to kinetochores [5-8]. However, due to the presence of these dual pathways, it has not been possible to distinguish differences in the nature of kinetochore assembly downstream of CENP-C or CENP-T. Here, we separated these pathways by targeting CENP-C and CENP-T independently to an ectopic chromosomal locus in human cells. Our work reveals that the organization of the KMN network components downstream of CENP-C and CENP-T is distinct. CENP-C recruits the Ndc80 complex through its interactions with KNL1 and the Mis12 complex. In contrast, CENP-T directly interacts with Ndc80, which in turn promotes KNL1/Mis12 complex recruitment through a separate region on CENP-T, resulting in functional relationships for KMN network localization that are inverted relative to the CENP-C pathway. We also find that distinct regulatory paradigms control the assembly of these pathways, with Aurora B kinase promoting KMN network recruitment to CENP-C and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) regulating KMN network recruitment to CENP-T. This work reveals unexpected complexity for the architecture and regulation of the core components of the kinetochore-microtubule interface.","","http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/","Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Biology, MIT, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.; Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Biology, MIT, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

To determine the mechanisms that achieve this, we engineered an ectopic, kinetochore-independent SAC activator: the ""eSAC."" The eSAC stimulates SAC signaling by artificially dimerizing Mps1 kinase domain and a cytosolic KNL1 phosphodomain, the kinetochore signaling scaffold. By exploiting variable eSAC expression in a cell population, we defined the dependence of the eSAC-induced mitotic delay on eSAC concentration in a cell to reveal the dose-response behavior of the core signaling cascade of the SAC. These quantitative analyses and subsequent mathematical modeling of the dose-response data uncover two crucial properties of the core SAC signaling cascade: (1) a cellular limit on the maximum anaphase-inhibitory signal that the cascade can generate due to the limited supply of SAC proteins and (2) the ability of the KNL1 phosphodomain to produce the anaphase-inhibitory signal synergistically, when it recruits multiple SAC proteins simultaneously. We propose that these properties together achieve inverse, non-linear scaling between the signal output per kinetochore and the number of signaling kinetochores. When the number of kinetochores is low, synergistic signaling by KNL1 enables each kinetochore to produce a disproportionately strong signal output. However, when many kinetochores signal concurrently, they compete for a limited supply of SAC proteins. This frustrates synergistic signaling and lowers their signal output. Thus, the signaling activity of unattached kinetochores will adapt to the changing number of signaling kinetochores to enable the SAC to approximate switch-like behavior.","cell signaling; eSAC; kinetochore; mitosis; spindle assembly checkpoint","http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/","Department of Biophysics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Department of Biology, MIT, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.; Department of Biological Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA.; Hubrecht Institute - KNAW (Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences), and Molecular Cancer Research, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.; Cell & Developmental Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biophysics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Cell & Developmental Biology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

We developed assembly assays to monitor the recruitment of green fluorescent protein-tagged recombinant proteins and native proteins from human cell extracts to inner kinetochore components immobilized on microbeads. In contrast to prior work in yeast and Xenopus egg extracts, we find that human mitotic cell extracts fail to support de novo assembly of microtubule-binding subcomplexes. A subset of interactions, such as those between CENP-A-containing nucleosomes and CENP-C, are permissive under these conditions. However, the subsequent phospho-dependent binding of the Mis12 complex is less efficient, whereas recruitment of the Ndc80 complex is blocked, leading to weak microtubule-binding activity of assembled particles. Using molecular variants of the Ndc80 complex, we show that auto-inhibition of native Ndc80 complex restricts its ability to bind to the CENP-T/W complex, whereas inhibition of the Ndc80 microtubule binding is driven by a different mechanism.

Here, we demonstrate that a conserved motif in the kinetochore protein KNL1 directly interacts with and targets protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the outer kinetochore. PP1 recruitment by KNL1 is required to dephosphorylate Aurora B substrates at kinetochores and stabilize microtubule attachments.

Once errors are corrected, the spindle-assembly checkpoint is silenced, allowing anaphase onset to occur. However, in the presence of persistent unresolvable errors, cells can undergo 'mitotic slippage', exiting mitosis into a tetraploid G1 state and escaping the cell death that results from a prolonged arrest. The molecular logic that enables cells to balance these duelling mitotic arrest and slippage behaviours remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that human cells modulate the duration of their mitotic arrest through the presence of conserved, alternative CDC20 translational isoforms. Downstream translation initiation results in a truncated CDC20 isoform that is resistant to spindle-assembly-checkpoint-mediated inhibition and promotes mitotic exit even in the presence of mitotic perturbations. Our study supports a model in which the relative levels of CDC20 translational isoforms control the duration of mitotic arrest. During a prolonged mitotic arrest, new protein synthesis and differential CDC20 isoform turnover create a timer, with mitotic exit occurring once the truncated Met43 isoform achieves sufficient levels. Targeted molecular changes or naturally occurring cancer mutations that alter CDC20 isoform ratios or its translational control modulate mitotic arrest duration and anti-mitotic drug sensitivity, with potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of human cancers.","","","Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA. icheese@wi.mit.edu.; Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA. icheese@wi.mit.edu.","en","Research Article",""

After nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), kinetochore-associated Mad1-Mad2 catalyzes MCC assembly until all chromosomes achieve bipolar attachment [1, 2]. Mad1-Mad2 and other factors are also incorporated into the fibrous corona, a phospho-dependent expansion of the outer kinetochore that precedes microtubule attachment [4-6]. The factor(s) involved in targeting Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores in higher eukaryotes remain controversial [7-12], and the specific phosphorylation event(s) that trigger corona formation remain elusive [5, 13]. We used genome editing to eliminate Bub1, KNL1, and the Rod-Zw10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex in human cells. We show that RZZ's sole role in SAC activation is to tether Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores. Separately, Mps1 kinase triggers fibrous corona formation by phosphorylating two N-terminal sites on Rod. In contrast, Bub1 and KNL1 activate kinetochore-bound Mad1-Mad2 to produce a ""wait anaphase"" signal but are not required for corona formation. We also show that clonal lines isolated after BUB1 disruption recover Bub1 expression and SAC function through nonsense-associated alternative splicing (NAS).

However, the molecular origins and evolution of such rearrangements are varied and poorly understood, with cancer cells often containing multiple, complex rearrangements. One mechanism that can lead to genomic rearrangements is the formation of a ""dicentric"" chromosome containing two functional centromeres. Indeed, such dicentric chromosomes have been observed in cancer cells. Here, we tested the ability of a single dicentric chromosome to contribute to genomic instability and neoplastic conversion in vertebrate cells. We developed a system to transiently and reversibly induce dicentric chromosome formation on a single chromosome with high temporal control. We find that induced dicentric chromosomes are frequently damaged and mis-segregated during mitosis, and that this leads to extensive chromosomal rearrangements including translocations with other chromosomes. Populations of pre-neoplastic cells in which a single dicentric chromosome is induced acquire extensive genomic instability and display hallmarks of cellular transformation including anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Our results suggest that a single dicentric chromosome could contribute to tumor initiation.","","","Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.","en","Research Article",""

Using time-lapse imaging, we find that Dvl localizes uniformly to puncta throughout the cell cortex in Prophase I-arrested oocytes but becomes enriched at the vegetal pole following meiotic resumption through a dissolution-reassembly mechanism. This process is driven by an initial disassembly phase of Dvl puncta, followed by selective reformation of Dvl assemblies at the vegetal pole. Rather than being driven by Wnt signaling, this localization behavior is coupled to meiotic cell cycle progression and influenced by Lamp1+ endosome association and Frizzled receptors pre-localized within the oocyte cortex. Our results reveal a cell cycle-linked mechanism by which maternal cellular polarity is transduced to the embryo through spatially regulated Dvl dynamics.","Dishevelled; Patiria miniata; Wnt; body axis; meiosis; oocyte; polarity; sea star; starfish","http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/","Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Embryology Course: Concepts and Techniques in Modern Developmental Biology, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA 02543, USA.

Here, we examined the conserved KNL-1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex (KMN) network, which is essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions in vivo. We identified two distinct microtubule-binding activities within the KMN network: one associated with the Ndc80/Nuf2 subunits of the Ndc80 complex, and a second in KNL-1. Formation of the complete KMN network, which additionally requires the Mis12 complex and the Spc24/Spc25 subunits of the Ndc80 complex, synergistically enhances microtubule-binding activity. Phosphorylation by Aurora B, which corrects improper kinetochore-microtubule connections in vivo, reduces the affinity of the Ndc80 complex for microtubules in vitro. Based on these findings, we propose that the conserved KMN network constitutes the core microtubule-binding site of the kinetochore.","","http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/","Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (UCSD), CMM-East, Room 3052, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. icheeseman@ucsd.edu","en","Research Article",""

Although we found that protein levels were broadly stable, our analysis reveals that dynamic waves of phosphorylation underlie each meiotic stage. We found that the phosphatase PP2A-B55 is reactivated at the meiosis I/meiosis II (MI/MII) transition, resulting in the preferential dephosphorylation of threonine residues. Selective dephosphorylation is critical for directing the MI/MII transition as altering PP2A-B55 substrate preferences disrupts key cell cycle events after MI. In addition, threonine to serine substitution of a conserved phosphorylation site in the substrate INCENP prevents its relocalization at anaphase I.

LAB-1 has been proposed to act in the latter by preventing the premature removal of the meiosis-specific cohesin REC-8 at metaphase I in C. elegans, yet the mechanism and scope of LAB-1 function remained unknown. Here we identify an unexpected earlier role for LAB-1 in promoting the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in prophase I. LAB-1 and REC-8 are both required for the chromosomal association of the cohesin complex subunit SMC-3. Depletion of lab-1 results in partial loss of sister chromatid cohesion in rec-8 and coh-4 coh-3 mutants and further enhanced chromatid dissociation in worms where all three kleisins are mutated. Moreover, lab-1 depletion results in increased Aurora B kinase (AIR-2) signals in early prophase I nuclei, coupled with a parallel decrease in signals for the PP1 homolog, GSP-2. Finally, LAB-1 directly interacts with GSP-1 and GSP-2. We propose that LAB-1 targets the PP1 homologs to the chromatin at the onset of meiosis I, thereby antagonizing AIR-2 and cooperating with the cohesin complex to promote sister chromatid association and normal progression of the meiotic program.","","","Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.","en","Research Article",""

However, CENP-A is not sufficient to drive full-kinetochore assembly, and it is not clear how centromeric chromatin is established. Here, we identify CENP-W as a component of the DNA-proximal constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of proteins. We demonstrate that CENP-W forms a DNA-binding complex together with the CCAN component CENP-T. This complex directly associates with nucleosomal DNA and with canonical histone H3, but not with CENP-A, in centromeric regions. CENP-T/CENP-W functions upstream of other CCAN components with the exception of CENP-C, an additional putative DNA-binding protein. Our analysis indicates that CENP-T/CENP-W and CENP-C provide distinct pathways to connect the centromere with outer kinetochore assembly. In total, our results suggest that the CENP-T/CENP-W complex is directly involved in establishment of centromere chromatin structure coordinately with CENP-A.","","http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/","Department of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Genetics and The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.","en","Research Article",""

We show here that Sli15 stimulates the in vitro, and likely in vivo, kinase activity of Ipl1, and Sli15 facilitates the association of Ipl1 with the mitotic spindle. The Ipl1-binding and -stimulating activities of Sli15 both reside within a region containing homology to the metazoan inner centromere protein (INCENP). Ipl1 and Sli15 also bind to Dam1, a microtubule-binding protein required for mitotic spindle integrity and kinetochore function. Sli15 and Dam1 are most likely physiological targets of Ipl1 since Ipl1 can phosphorylate both proteins efficiently in vitro, and the in vivo phosphorylation of both proteins is reduced in ipl1 mutants. Some dam1 mutations exacerbate the phenotype of ipl1 and sli15 mutants, thus providing evidence that Dam1 interactions with Ipl1-Sli15 are functionally important in vivo. Similar to Dam1, Ipl1 and Sli15 each bind to microtubules directly in vitro, and they are associated with yeast centromeric DNA in vivo.

In addition, our analysis suggests that the network is comprised of three groups of proteins that contribute in distinct ways to this interface: KNL proteins act after the assembly of centromeric chromatin to generate the core of the microtubule-binding interface, MIS proteins control the rate and extent of formation of this interface, and NDC proteins are necessary to sustain tension during interactions with spindle microtubules. We also purify a similar set of associated proteins from human cells that includes four novel proteins and has recognizable homologs from each functional class.

This selective control can arise due to molecular density-enhanced binding, as recently found for the kinetochore scaffold protein CENP-T. When clustered, CENP-T recruits markedly more Ndc80 complexes than its monomeric counterpart, but the underlying molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we use quantitative in vitro assays to reveal two distinct mechanisms driving this behavior. First, Ndc80 binding to CENP-T is a two-step process: initially, Ndc80 molecules rapidly associate and dissociate from disordered N-terminal binding sites on CENP-T. Over time, these sites undergo maturation, resulting in stronger Ndc80 retention. Second, we find that this maturation transition is regulated by a kinetic barrier that is sensitive to the molecular environment. In the soluble phase, binding site maturation is slow, but within CENP-T clusters, this process is markedly accelerated. Notably, the two Ndc80 binding sites in human CENP-T exhibit distinct maturation rates and environmental sensitivities, which correlate with their different amino-acid content and predicted binding conformations. This clustering-induced maturation is evident in dividing human cells, suggesting a distinct regulatory entry point for controlling kinetochore assembly. We propose that the tunable acceleration of binding site maturation by molecular crowding may represent a general mechanism for promoting the formation of macromolecular structures. Significance Statement: A distinctive mechanism of protein-protein interaction underpins the assembly of kinetochores, which is critical for human cell division. During mitosis, the Ndc80 complex must bind tightly to the unstructured N-terminus of its receptor, CENP-T, which is densely clustered at kinetochores. Using single-molecule in vitro assays, we show that Ndc80 binding is mediated by an initially unstable yet tunable interface. The high molecular density of CENP-T at the kinetochores accelerates the maturation of this binding interface, favoring the formation of stable complexes within the kinetochore structure, rather than in the soluble phase. This environment-driven modulation of binding site maturation may represent a key regulatory mechanism for ensuring strong and specific interactions during the assembly of macromolecular complexes such as kinetochores.","","","","en","","bioRxivorg"
