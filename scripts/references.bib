               implicating gene targets in specific cellular processes.

               investigate the functional relationship between HCP-1/2, two
               redundant CENP-F-like proteins, and CLASP(CLS-2) in

               identical kinetic profiles, and biochemical purifications
               demonstrate that they also associate physically. In embryos
               depleted of HCP-1/2, CLASP(CLS-2) no longer localizes to
               chromosomes, whereas CLASP(CLS-2) depletion does not prevent
               HCP-1/2 targeting. Consistent with the localization dependency
               and biochemical association, depletion of HCP-1/2 or
               CLASP(CLS-2) resulted in virtually identical defects in mitotic

               partially suppressed by disrupting the astral forces that pull

               CLASP(CLS-2) is required for biorientation when
               chromosome-spindle attachments are subjected to poleward force.
               Our results establish that the key role of HCP-1/2 is to target
               CLASP(CLS-2) to kinetochores, and they support the recently

               demonstrate that the N-terminal region of vertebrate CENP-T
               interacts with the 'RWD' domain in the Spc24/25 portion of the
               Ndc80 complex. Phosphorylation of CENP-T strengthens a cryptic
               hydrophobic interaction between CENP-T and Spc25 resulting in a
               phospho-regulated interaction that occurs without direct
               recognition of the phosphorylated residue. The Ndc80 complex
               interacts with both CENP-T and the Mis12 complex, but we find
               that these interactions are mutually exclusive, supporting a
               model in which two distinct pathways target the Ndc80 complex to
               kinetochores. Our results provide a model for how the multiple

              gene was mapped and found to lie in a tight cluster of five
              highly similar genes (Wak1-5) within a 30 kb region. All of the

              epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats. The extracellular regions
              also contain limited amino acid identities to the tenascin
              superfamily, collagen, or the neurexins. RNA blot analysis with
              gene-specific probes revealed that Wak1, Wak3 and Wak5 are
              expressed primarily in leaves and stems of Arabidopsis. Wak4 mRNA
              is only detected in siliques, while Wak2 mRNA is found in high

               inhibition, which abolishes both SPDL-1 and dynein/dynactin

              To better understand how kinetochores attach to microtubules and

              Low-efficiency initiation sites are preferentially repressed in

              key regulator of start-codon selection, eIF1, and the 40S
              ribosome. We find that increased eIF1-40S ribosome interactions

               programs have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that
               mammalian germ cells express an alternative mRNA splice isoform
               for the kinetochore component, DSN1, a subunit of the MIS12
               complex that links the centromeres to spindle microtubules
               during chromosome segregation. This germline DSN1 isoform
               bypasses the requirement for Aurora kinase phosphorylation for
               its centromere localization due to the absence of a key
               regulatory region allowing DSN1 to display persistent centromere
               localization. Expression of the germline DSN1 isoform in somatic
               cells results in constitutive kinetochore localization,
               chromosome segregation errors, and growth defects, providing an
               explanation for its tight cell-type-specific expression.
               Reciprocally, precisely eliminating expression of the
               germline-specific DSN1 splice isoform in mouse models disrupts
               oocyte maturation and early embryonic divisions coupled with a

               stringency of start-codon selection during mitosis results from
               increased association between the 40S ribosome and the key
               regulator of start-codon selection, eIF1. We find that increased

               dynein exhibits a dynamic asymmetric cortical localization that
               is negatively regulated by spindle-pole proximity, resulting in

               anaphase-inhibitory signal that the cascade can generate due to
               the limited supply of SAC proteins and (2) the ability of the
               KNL1 phosphodomain to produce the anaphase-inhibitory signal
               synergistically, when it recruits multiple SAC proteins
               simultaneously. We propose that these properties together
               achieve inverse, non-linear scaling between the signal output
               per kinetochore and the number of signaling kinetochores. When
               the number of kinetochores is low, synergistic signaling by KNL1
               enables each kinetochore to produce a disproportionately strong
               signal output. However, when many kinetochores signal
               concurrently, they compete for a limited supply of SAC proteins.
               This frustrates synergistic signaling and lowers their signal
               output. Thus, the signaling activity of unattached kinetochores
               will adapt to the changing number of signaling kinetochores to
               enable the SAC to approximate switch-like behavior.",

               fibrous corona, a phospho-dependent expansion of the outer

               their function, driving tumor formation or progression. However,
               the molecular origins and evolution of such rearrangements are
               varied and poorly understood, with cancer cells often containing
               multiple, complex rearrangements. One mechanism that can lead to
               genomic rearrangements is the formation of a ``dicentric''
               chromosome containing two functional centromeres. Indeed, such
               dicentric chromosomes have been observed in cancer cells. Here,
               we tested the ability of a single dicentric chromosome to
               contribute to genomic instability and neoplastic conversion in
               vertebrate cells. We developed a system to transiently and
               reversibly induce dicentric chromosome formation on a single
               chromosome with high temporal control. We find that induced
               dicentric chromosomes are frequently damaged and mis-segregated
               during mitosis, and that this leads to extensive chromosomal
               rearrangements including translocations with other chromosomes.
               Populations of pre-neoplastic cells in which a single dicentric
               chromosome is induced acquire extensive genomic instability and
               display hallmarks of cellular transformation including
               anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Our results suggest

               overexpression caused defects in mitosis and a mitotic arrest.
               Duo1p was localized by immunofluorescence, by immunoelectron

               Temperature-sensitive duo1 mutants arrest with short spindles.
               This arrest is dependent on the mitotic checkpoint. Dam1p was
               identified by two-hybrid analysis as a protein that binds to
               Duo1p. By expressing a GFP-Dam1p fusion protein in yeast, Dam1p

  abstract  = "The four-subunit Ndc80 complex, comprised of Ndc80/Nuf2 and
               Spc24/Spc25 dimers, directly connects kinetochores to spindle
               microtubules. The complex is anchored to the kinetochore at the
               Spc24/25 end, and the Ndc80/Nuf2 dimer projects outward to bind
               to microtubules. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy and
               helical image analysis to visualize the interaction of the
               Ndc80/Nuf2 dimer with microtubules. Our results, when combined
               with crystallography data, suggest that the globular domain of
               the Ndc80 subunit binds strongly at the interface between
               tubulin dimers and weakly at the adjacent intradimer interface
               along the protofilament axis. Such a binding mode, in which the
               Ndc80 complex interacts with sequential alpha/beta-tubulin
               heterodimers, may be important for stabilizing kinetochore-bound
               microtubules. Additionally, we define the binding of the Ndc80
               complex relative to microtubule polarity, which reveals that the
               microtubule interaction surface is at a considerable distance
               from the opposite kinetochore-anchored end; this binding
               geometry may facilitate polymerization and depolymerization at
               kinetochore-attached microtubule ends.",

  abstract = "Macromolecular assembly depends on tightly regulated pairwise
              binding interactions that are selectively favored at assembly
              sites while being disfavored in the soluble phase. This selective
              control can arise due to molecular density-enhanced binding, as
              recently found for the kinetochore scaffold protein CENP-T. When
              clustered, CENP-T recruits markedly more Ndc80 complexes than its
              monomeric counterpart, but the underlying molecular basis remains
              elusive. Here, we use quantitative in vitro assays to reveal two
              distinct mechanisms driving this behavior. First, Ndc80 binding
              to CENP-T is a two-step process: initially, Ndc80 molecules
              rapidly associate and dissociate from disordered N-terminal
              binding sites on CENP-T. Over time, these sites undergo
              maturation, resulting in stronger Ndc80 retention. Second, we
              find that this maturation transition is regulated by a kinetic
              barrier that is sensitive to the molecular environment. In the
              soluble phase, binding site maturation is slow, but within CENP-T
              clusters, this process is markedly accelerated. Notably, the two
              Ndc80 binding sites in human CENP-T exhibit distinct maturation
              rates and environmental sensitivities, which correlate with their
              different amino-acid content and predicted binding conformations.
              This clustering-induced maturation is evident in dividing human
              cells, suggesting a distinct regulatory entry point for
              controlling kinetochore assembly. We propose that the tunable
              acceleration of binding site maturation by molecular crowding may
              represent a general mechanism for promoting the formation of
              macromolecular structures. Significance Statement: A distinctive
              mechanism of protein-protein interaction underpins the assembly
              of kinetochores, which is critical for human cell division.
              During mitosis, the Ndc80 complex must bind tightly to the
              unstructured N-terminus of its receptor, CENP-T, which is densely
              clustered at kinetochores. Using single-molecule in vitro assays,
              we show that Ndc80 binding is mediated by an initially unstable
              yet tunable interface. The high molecular density of CENP-T at
              the kinetochores accelerates the maturation of this binding
              interface, favoring the formation of stable complexes within the
              kinetochore structure, rather than in the soluble phase. This
              environment-driven modulation of binding site maturation may
              represent a key regulatory mechanism for ensuring strong and
              specific interactions during the assembly of macromolecular
              complexes such as kinetochores.",
